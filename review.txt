Style: The style is mostly consistent and readable, however the amount of
whitespace is excessive. As far as following the department's standard, it
dosen't, but that standard is outdated and sucks anyways.

Fuck Them


Documentation: There is almost no documentation in the code itself, but 
the documentation in the header files is already enough.

Readability/structure: Most of the code makes sense, although:
    if( a )
        return true
    else
        return false
Can be replaced by simply:
    return a

Correctness: The code is correct, however the output does not match the sample.
Remember to diff your output!

Efficiency: The only inefficiency that stands out is creating and looping over
arrays each time in the find_exit() function.
